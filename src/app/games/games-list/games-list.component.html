<!--
  If there are multipul areas where we want to use the
  games$ observable, or if we want to easily display a
  placeholder while fetching data - we can use *ngIf - and
  assign it to a local template property called games.

  Otherwise, we want to display the ng-template called loading.

  For a more detailed explanation see - https://toddmotto.com/angular-ngif-async-pipe
-->
<div *ngIf="(games$ | async) as games; else loading">
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly">
        <app-game-card *ngFor="let game of games" [game]="game"></app-game-card>
  </div>
</div>
<ng-template #loading>
  Loading .....
</ng-template>
